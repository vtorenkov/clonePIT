# Git Flow

We follow the GitHub Flow model. More information on how this flow works can be found [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

The flow will be as follows:

- Create a new branch from development
- Make development changes
- Create a pull request from the new branch back into development (assign a reviwer)
- Review/test the PR and make any necessary changes
- Merge the PR into development and delete the feature branch
